                    What was the most impactful thing(s) you learned this week and why do you
                    think so?
                    <p>
                        Wow each week is new knowledge and one surprise what is possible to do with CSS. 
                        This week I know Zen Garden your proposal and some designs, it was many tasks to do and readings.
                        I liked the comparison of the website with the Atomic Design Methodology 
                        (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages), it first was weird, but after made total sense.
                        And one thing I can learn this week was about teamwork, how important communication and helping one another.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What questions do you have about this week's chosen topic(s) and/or exercises
                    (first-time students) or websites you are working on (repeat students)?
                    <p>
                        I don't question it, I'm only excited about Zen Garden, it's hard but pretty cool.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you like specific feedback from your instructor? If so, what things
                    would you like feedback on? (Please use the Canvas calendar to schedule
                    time to meet with your instructor or attend a study session.)
                    <p>At the time no.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where would you go next to learn more about this week's topic(s)? Give 2-3
                    links to resources that look promising to help answer the questions you
                    indicated in the quiz question above.
                    <p>
                        This week I searched fonts, colors, and wireframes for Zen Garden, 
                        I visited the <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://labs.jensimmons.com/">Labs Jen Simmons</a> and the 
                        the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/pt">Lucid</a> that help me with wireframes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did you participate with the class on Slack? (You can participate by asking a
                    question, answering a question, or sharing a resource you’ve found. Or you
                    can share your thoughts on what you’re learning this week. Or you can answer
                    any questions your instructor might have given in their announcement.)
                    <p>
                        I didn't.

                <li>
                    Please rate your success with learning and this week’s work on a scale of 1 to 4.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Please rate yourself at the level you feel most closely matches your learning; 1 is
                            the lowest rating and 4 is the highest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feel free to use decimals if you feel you must.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your answers to questions 1 through 4 are your justification for your rating.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is most of your grade for your reflection, you also receive one point for
                            submitting the other required items.
                        <li>
                            Your instructor won’t grade your assignment until you submit the required
                            items (screenshot, zipped files, etc.)
                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor disagrees substantially with your rating, they can raise it or
                            lower it to signal to you their expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor lowers your rating, your instructor might contact you to arrange
                            a meeting to see how they can help you. Feel free to reach out to them as well.
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            I think I have a good understanding of the Zen Garden, the Atomic Design Methodology (the analogy), 
                            and some tips about Design Systems so I consider my level 3 for this week.
