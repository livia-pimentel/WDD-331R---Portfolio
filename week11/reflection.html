                    What was the most impactful thing(s) you learned this week and why do you
                    think so?
                    <p>
                        This week I could understand a little better about Dev Tools and learned new 
                        functionality that I didn't know for example CSS Overview
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What questions do you have about this week's chosen topic(s) and/or exercises
                    (first-time students) or websites you are working on (repeat students)?
                    <p>
                        I have no questions at the moment.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you like specific feedback from your instructor? If so, what things
                    would you like feedback on? (Please use the Canvas calendar to schedule
                    time to meet with your instructor or attend a study session.)
                    <p>At the time no.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where would you go next to learn more about this week's topic(s)? Give 2-3
                    links to resources that look promising to help answer the questions you
                    indicated in the quiz question above.
                    <p>
                        I watched some videos: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYcj2IVD70A">Chrome Dev Tools Debugging CSS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KvBSpGLQa0">DevTools CSS</a>,
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQHzW_DozU&t=1001s">CSS Ninja: Ferramentas para acelerar o Desenvolvimento Web</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kzHrOpyElI&t=316s">#Google Lighthouse O que é e como usar?</a>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did you participate with the class on Slack? (You can participate by asking a
                    question, answering a question, or sharing a resource you’ve found. Or you
                    can share your thoughts on what you’re learning this week. Or you can answer
                    any questions your instructor might have given in their announcement.)
                    <p>
                       Yes, I shared one vídeo.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please rate your success with learning and this week’s work on a scale of 1 to 4.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Please rate yourself at the level you feel most closely matches your learning; 1 is
                            the lowest rating and 4 is the highest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feel free to use decimals if you feel you must.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your answers to questions 1 through 4 are your justification for your rating.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is most of your grade for your reflection, you also receive one point for
                            submitting the other required items.
                        <li>
                            Your instructor won’t grade your assignment until you submit the required
                            items (screenshot, zipped files, etc.)
                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor disagrees substantially with your rating, they can raise it or
                            lower it to signal to you their expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor lowers your rating, your instructor might contact you to arrange
                            a meeting to see how they can help you. Feel free to reach out to them as well.
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            I believe my rate this week was 1.5 because I was unable to enjoy most of the content on SitePoint (I don't have a subscription), including not being able 
                            to do this week's ponder for the same reason, watch some videos to help me understand better but I don't think it was enough.
