    <h2>Recommendations to improve website performance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Replace PNG or JPEG format images with formats such as WebP or AVIF.</li>
        <li>Provide images with adequate sizes.</li>
        <li>Reduce unused CSS and JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Add Accessible Names to Button Tags.</li>
        <li>Increase the contrast ratio between colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These simple changes will improve the page load time and increase the accessibility of the site, 
        there are free tools to convert images from PNG or JPG to WebP or AVIF one of them is <a target="_blank" href="https://convertio.co/pt/">Convertio</a>,
        the same goes for resizing the images a free tool is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iloveimg.com/pt/redimensionar-imagem">iloveimg</a>.<br>
        It is possible to identify unused files with dev tools by typing the coverage command in the console, and to test the color contrast there are several tools for this, 
        one of which is <a target="_blank" href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Webaim</a>.
