                    What was the most impactful thing(s) you learned this week and why do you
                    think so?
                    <p>
                        This week I could improve my understanding of how the flexbox works (moving the elements in the axis, setting to not surpass the 
                        boundaries, and spacing e position between elements). <br>
                        Another thing very important for me this week was studied about components and architecture in CSS, I had no idea about any 
                        international conventions or methodologies such as BEM, SMACSS, and others. Reading about this theme broke some conceptions that 
                        I believed right, such as more specificity better, avoiding the use ID's, do not link the styles to the HTML tags but to the class. 
                        One thing I think was very cool was separating the concerns (layout, structure, and styles) and don't put everything in one only selector, 
                        because overloaded and hard to reuse.<br>
                        It was a lot of new information and conceptions and I hope to get to put into practice some things.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    What questions do you have about this week's chosen topic(s) and/or exercises
                    (first-time students) or websites you are working on (repeat students)?
                    <p>
                        I have, but not about the topic this week.<br> 
                        My doubt is when do I need to use normalize.css? And is it better to use the normalize.css file or the link in HTML?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you like specific feedback from your instructor? If so, what things
                    would you like feedback on? (Please use the Canvas calendar to schedule
                    time to meet with your instructor or attend a study session.)
                    <p>At the time no.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where would you go next to learn more about this week's topic(s)? Give 2-3
                    links to resources that look promising to help answer the questions you
                    indicated in the quiz question above.
                    <p>
                        This week I could study Components and Architecture in CSS and was very nice. 
                        I read the material in the module and  watch one video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltjnLyjFZk">BEM</a>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did you participate with the class on Slack? (You can participate by asking a
                    question, answering a question, or sharing a resource you’ve found. Or you
                    can share your thoughts on what you’re learning this week. Or you can answer
                    any questions your instructor might have given in their announcement.)
                    <p>
                        Yes, I did.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please rate your success with learning and this week’s work on a scale of 1 to 4.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Please rate yourself at the level you feel most closely matches your learning; 1 is
                            the lowest rating and 4 is the highest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feel free to use decimals if you feel you must.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your answers to questions 1 through 4 are your justification for your rating.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is most of your grade for your reflection, you also receive one point for
                            submitting the other required items.
                        <li>
                            Your instructor won’t grade your assignment until you submit the required
                            items (screenshot, zipped files, etc.)
                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor disagrees substantially with your rating, they can raise it or
                            lower it to signal to you their expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor lowers your rating, your instructor might contact you to arrange
                            a meeting to see how they can help you. Feel free to reach out to them as well.
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            My rate this week is 3, because I think 
                            I could understand many new concepts about components and architecture, and improve my knowledge of Flexbox.
