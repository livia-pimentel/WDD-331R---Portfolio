                    What was the most impactful thing(s) you learned this week and why do you
                    think so?
                    <p>
                        I didn't idea how SVG worked, this week was very useful I could learn the ways I can use SVG (img, path, object, embed, and others) and its positive and negative points. And how as difficult to do SVG on hand, but I could learn about coordination (x, y) 
                        and your impact in shapes into SVG. In tasks were many trial and error, but was possible to see their behavior.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What questions do you have about this week's chosen topic(s) and/or exercises
                    (first-time students) or websites you are working on (repeat students)?
                    <p>
                        How much do I need to know how to manipulate programs to create SVG?
                        And for example, I know that for images I need to be careful about copyright, does the same happen for SVG? 
                        If so, do you have any sources you can point me to to get copyright free SVG?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you like specific feedback from your instructor? If so, what things
                    would you like feedback on? (Please use the Canvas calendar to schedule
                    time to meet with your instructor or attend a study session.)
                    <p>At the time no.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where would you go next to learn more about this week's topic(s)? Give 2-3
                    links to resources that look promising to help answer the questions you
                    indicated in the quiz question above.
                    <p>
                        I watched some videos about SVG in general and another about path.<br>

                    Did you participate with the class on Slack? (You can participate by asking a
                    question, answering a question, or sharing a resource you’ve found. Or you
                    can share your thoughts on what you’re learning this week. Or you can answer
                    any questions your instructor might have given in their announcement.)
                    <p>
                        Yes, I did.

                    Please rate your success with learning and this week’s work on a scale of 1 to 4.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Please rate yourself at the level you feel most closely matches your learning; 1 is
                            the lowest rating and 4 is the highest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feel free to use decimals if you feel you must.

                        <li>
                            Your answers to questions 1 through 4 are your justification for your rating.

                        <li>
                            This is most of your grade for your reflection, you also receive one point for
                            submitting the other required items.
                        <li>
                            Your instructor won’t grade your assignment until you submit the required
                            items (screenshot, zipped files, etc.)
                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor disagrees substantially with your rating, they can raise it or
                            lower it to signal to you their expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor lowers your rating, your instructor might contact you to arrange
                            a meeting to see how they can help you. Feel free to reach out to them as well.
                        </li>

                            I think 3, it was really cool this week, I had no idea how SVG worked much less that it can be used in many ways, it was very interesting to know 
                            that we can develop in html itself, in programs like Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, or get it from the internet . Of course, I had a lot of difficulty 
                            doing the exercises because there were many attempts until something acceptable came out in my view, and I also don't know h
                            ow to use the programs that facilitate this creation.
