                    What was the most impactful thing(s) you learned this week and why do you
                    think so?
                    <p>
                        I didn't know anything about SASS, and I guess very nice to know that is possible to optimize the CSS with possibilities to create variables, functions, and the @mixin that 
                        I code something and reuse when necessary, I liked to use nesting because helped me to organize better the code. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What questions do you have about this week's chosen topic(s) and/or exercises
                    (first-time students) or websites you are working on (repeat students)?
                    <p>
                        In the previous task (about form) I didn't understand very well what is -webkit and -ms. When should I use them?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you like specific feedback from your instructor? If so, what things
                    would you like feedback on? (Please use the Canvas calendar to schedule
                    time to meet with your instructor or attend a study session.)
                    <p>At the time no.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where would you go next to learn more about this week's topic(s)? Give 2-3
                    links to resources that look promising to help answer the questions you
                    indicated in the quiz question above.
                    <p>
                        I usually look for content on youtube, because I understand it better watching. This week I watch some videos about SASS:<br>

                    Did you participate with the class on Slack? (You can participate by asking a
                    question, answering a question, or sharing a resource you’ve found. Or you
                    can share your thoughts on what you’re learning this week. Or you can answer
                    any questions your instructor might have given in their announcement.)
                    <p>
                        I didn't.

                    Please rate your success with learning and this week’s work on a scale of 1 to 4.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Please rate yourself at the level you feel most closely matches your learning; 1 is
                            the lowest rating and 4 is the highest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feel free to use decimals if you feel you must.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your answers to questions 1 through 4 are your justification for your rating.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is most of your grade for your reflection, you also receive one point for
                            submitting the other required items.
                        <li>
                            Your instructor won’t grade your assignment until you submit the required
                            items (screenshot, zipped files, etc.)
                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor disagrees substantially with your rating, they can raise it or
                            lower it to signal to you their expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor lowers your rating, your instructor might contact you to arrange
                            a meeting to see how they can help you. Feel free to reach out to them as well.
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            My level this week is 2.5 because I didn't understand some things and had difficulty doing the exercise, 
                            used the @mixin with @media it got me a little confused and I don't know if I did it the right way.
