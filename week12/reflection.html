                    What was the most impactful thing(s) you learned this week and why do you
                    think so?
                    <p>
                        When I started to learn HTML and CSS I listened about Bootstrap, but I didn't know anything, in this week I could learn what
                         is and how works I really liked this amazing framework. I watched many videos, read a lot of parts of 
                        the documentation to make my prove, and was passionate about what I could absorb and learn this week. I loved this experience!

                    What questions do you have about this week's chosen topic(s) and/or exercises
                    (first-time students) or websites you are working on (repeat students)?
                    <p>
                        Do you use frameworks like Bootstrap a lot in real projects?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you like specific feedback from your instructor? If so, what things
                    would you like feedback on? (Please use the Canvas calendar to schedule
                    time to meet with your instructor or attend a study session.)

                    </p>

                <li>
                    Did you participate with the class on Slack? (You can participate by asking a

                    any questions your instructor might have given in their announcement.)
                    <p>
                       Yes, I shared one video about Bootstrap.

                    Please rate your success with learning and this week’s work on a scale of 1 to 4.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Please rate yourself at the level you feel most closely matches your learning; 1 is
                            the lowest rating and 4 is the highest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feel free to use decimals if you feel you must.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your answers to questions 1 through 4 are your justification for your rating.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is most of your grade for your reflection, you also receive one point for
                            submitting the other required items.
                        <li>
                            Your instructor won’t grade your assignment until you submit the required
                            items (screenshot, zipped files, etc.)
                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor disagrees substantially with your rating, they can raise it or
                            lower it to signal to you their expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your instructor lowers your rating, your instructor might contact you to arrange
                            a meeting to see how they can help you. Feel free to reach out to them as well.
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            I think my rate was 3.5 this week, I really learned a lot and was passionate about this framework.
                        </p>
