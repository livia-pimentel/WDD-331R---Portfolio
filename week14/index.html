    <h1>Final Self Evaluation</h1>
    <p>I'm so grateful for everything I could learned in this class, now my vision about CSS is other I'm feeling more confident working with CSS.
        I worked hard in all activities, it's a little more difficult for me because I don't work with this, but I learned and improve a lot compared to before.<br>
        The code that can demonstrate how I improved was Zen Garden, was necessary to put and applied many concepts learned like grid, position (relative, absolute, fixed - like used in sidebar), atomic design, specificity, responsiveness and many others.
        Of course, I have much more to learn and practice, but I'm really satisfied with what I learned.
